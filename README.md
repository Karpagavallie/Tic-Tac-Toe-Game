 1. Game Description

A classic two-player Tic Tac Toe game implemented as a command-line interface. Players alternate turns placing *X* or *O* in a 3×3 grid until one wins or the board is full.

 2. Key Features

* Text-based, easy-to-use interface
* Two-player mode (X vs O)
* Detects and announces a win or a tie after each move
* Displays the board state after every turn

 3. How It Works

* The board is represented by a list of 9 cells numbered 1–9.
* Players input a number to place their symbol.
* The game checks for winning combinations (rows, columns, diagonals) or a full board.
* The board is re-displayed each turn to reflect the current state.

4.Features of this implementation:

* Uses a list of strings for board state
* Clean board printing and input validation
* Dynamic win checking via tuple patterns

 5. Future Enhancements

* *Scorekeeping tracker* across multiple sessions
* *Single-player mode* with an AI (minimax or random) ([geeksforgeeks.org][1], [github.com][2], [techarge.in][3])
* *Symbol customization* (choose X, O, or others)
* *GUI version* using tkinter or pygame&#x20;

 6. Benefits & Learning Goals

* *Problem-solving & logic*: Managing game flow, win detection
* *User interface handling*: accepting valid input and updating the board
* *Data structures*: using lists and loops efficiently
* *Modular code*: functions separated for clarity and maintainability

7. Extensions & Similar Projects

Once this is functional, try exploring:

* Rock, Paper, Scissors (simple rules, input logic)
* Hangman (string processing & guess validation)
* Sudoku solver (grid handling and recursive logic)
* Chess engine (advanced grids and move generation)
